# Simple Exercises for Quantum Computing
This repository contains Jupyter Notebook files to start expremineting with gate-model quantum computers. The excersises are based on **qiskit** SDK, and are only tested on IBM Q quantum backends.

## Let's start with a classic search example
Run **search_classic.ipynb** to review the complexity of an unstructured search problem.

## Grover's algorithm 
The Grover's algorithm brings quadratic speedup to the problem of unstructured search.

### Overall structure of the lagorithm
### Building the oracle funtion
### Building the rotation function
